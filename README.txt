Comments: go to the specific path where files are located. Now type “make”. It will create executables and .o files. To clean type : make clean. It will delete all executables and .o files.

(A) Doubly-linked Circular List : 40 out of 40 pts

(B.1) Sort (file) : 30 out of 30 pts
(B.2) Sort (stdin) : 30 out of 30 pts

Missing required section(s) in README file :0 (Fulfilled all the requirements)
Cannot compile : 0 (All the files are compiled without errors and warning)
Compiler warnings :0 (Removed all the compiler warnings)
"make clean" :0 (This command is able to delete all executables and .o files)
Segmentation faults : 0 (I had handled all the cases I can generate myself)
Separate compilation : 0 (Created total 4 files : warmup1.c , warmup1.h , print.c , sort.c)
Malformed input : 0 (Handles all malformed inputs with error print )
Too slow : 0 ( Runs Fast)
Bad commandline : 0 (Handled proper exceptions for this too)
Bad behavior for random input :0 ( Checked for 50 times to verify the behavior. Solved many exceptions which had appeared)
Did not use My402List and My402ListElem to implement "sort" in (B) : 0 (My code is dependent on My402list.c files as it is using required functions)

Comments: As far as I know I had handled all the cases with proper malloc and free.
